### Usage Requirements

To take full advantage of our Unity Gen2 service, you will need to [Create an Edgegap Free Tier account](https://app.edgegap.com/auth/register). Our Free Tier let's you test and explore all of Gen2 features for free, no credit card required!

### Troubleshooting

> Visual Studio shows `type or namespace name could not be found` for Edgegap namespace.
1. In your Unity Editor, navigate to **Edit / Preferences / External Tools / Generate .csproj files**.
2. Make sure you have enabled **Git packages**.
3. Click **Regenerate project files**.

## Update the Plugin in Unity

Before updating, take note of your `Client Version` property on `Gen2Client.cs` to ensure future compatibility.

Depending on your installation method:

- If you installed with git, locate it in Unity's **Package Manager** window and click **Update**. Wait for the process to complete and you're good to go!
- If you installed via ZIP archive, you will need to remove the previous copy, then download the new version.

### Migrating Scenes

1. **Replace any missing scripts in your scenes!**

   - Verify validity of your `Gen2Client.cs` properties like `BaseUrl` and `AuthToken`.

2. **Increase `Client Version` property value of your `Gen2Client.cs` script!**

   - This will prevent loading outdated tickets from cache when matchmaking resumed.

3. You may want to modify your client & server handler scripts.
